processing-eclipse
==================

This is an Eclipse plugin that provides a “Processing” mode for Eclipse.

It was created in 2010 by Chris Lonnen as a Google Summer of Code project,
as part of an exploration on how we might replace the current Processing editor
and development environment with something more advanced.

This project is not under active development, but the source is here 
in the hope of some kind soul picking it up and continuing. 

Please contribute!
